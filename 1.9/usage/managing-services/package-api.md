The Package Management API allows you to install DC/OS services from DC/OS packages stored in a DC/OS package registry, such as the [Mesosphere Universe](/docs/1.9/overview/concepts/#mesosphere-universe).

The [DC/OS Package Manager (Cosmos) component](/docs/1.9/overview/architecture/components/#dcos-package-manager) runs on all master nodes.

For information about managing package repositories, see [Managing Package Repositories](/docs/1.9/usage/repo/).

For information about managing services, see [Managing Services](/docs/1.9/usage/managing-services/).
