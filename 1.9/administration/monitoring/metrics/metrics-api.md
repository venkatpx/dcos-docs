The Metrics API exposes node, container, and application metrics.

The Metrics API is backed by the [DC/OS Metrics component](/docs/1.9/overview/architecture/components/#dcos-metrics), which runs on all nodes in the cluster.

For more information about using the Metrics API, see [Metrics](/docs/1.9/administration/metrics/).


## Routes

Access to the Metrics API is proxied through the Admin Router on each node using the following route:

```
/system/v1/metrics/v1/
```

Access to the Metrics API of the agent nodes is also proxied through the master nodes, so that it can be accessed from outside of the cluster:

```
/system/v1/agent/{agent_id}/metrics/v1/
```

To determine the address of your cluster, see [Cluster Access](/docs/1.9/api/access/).


## Format

The Metrics API request and response bodies are formatted in JSON.

Requests must include the accept header:

```
Accept: application/json
```

Responses will include the content type header:

```
Content-Type: application/json
```


## Resources

The following resources are available under both of the above routes:
